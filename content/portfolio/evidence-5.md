## Background

There have been many motivations for me to incorporate Aboriginal and  Torres Strait Islander culture and history in lessons: the Aboriginal  Cultural Standards Framework workshops, the Graduate Teacher Induction  Program, recommendations from other teaching staff and the AIEO, as well  as the AITSL Standards. When I was teaching Year 10 Biological Sciences, I realised there are many Indigenous rules to prevent the  genetic diversity and decided to plan a mini investigation lesson on the  Aboriginal kinship system (*Descriptors 2.4 and 6.1*).

## Outcomes

After reading through [the Teacher Background Information](https://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/TeacherBackgroundInfo?id=56349) on the topic, as well as other informative articles provided by various Aboriginal Councils (e.g. [link](https://www.clc.org.au/articles/info/aboriginal-kinship)), I started planning on the lesson. Below are the annotated lesson plan and the worksheet for the students.

As discussed in the annotations, I realised the link between the concept of genetic diversity and the kinship system was not stressed enough in the lesson, and needed to be reinforced. In the beginning of the next lesson, I revised the kinship system briefly, and discussed other incest taboos around the world. Then I made a specific comment on the terms variation and diversity, and linked all together.

I was happy to deliver a lesson addressing the Indigenous cultures but I was also aware of the fact that it lacked the local information. Discussions with the AIEO, as well as the local Aboriginal Council (if available) would transform this lesson significantly richer in content and more relatable.
