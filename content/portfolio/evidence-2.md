## Background

During my first year of service, one of the biggest challenges of teaching came from behaviour management. I struggled to maintain a comfortable learning environment for students -- there were arguments and power struggles. I sometimes could not respond efficiently and appropriately to a certain behaviour. I received a lot of stress as a result of my poor practice.

## Action and Outcomes

I needed additional professional advice to improve my behaviour  management skills. Not just knowledge and tips, but also objective feedback and structured reflections were what I felt I lacked of. Based on the information from the Graduate Teacher Induction Program and recommendations from other teaching staff, I signed up for the [Graduate Teacher In-class Coaching Program](http://det.wa.edu.au/curriculumsupport/detcms/navigation/targeted-support/graduate-teacher-induction-program/?page=5#toc5) and the [Classroom Management Strategies training](http://det.wa.edu.au/studentsupport/behaviourandwellbeing/detcms/navigation/positive-classrooms/classroom-management-strategies/). The two courses included self-reflection and classroom observation sessions so they suited my purpose well (*Descriptor 6.1*).

### In-class Coaching Program

Before the commencement of the Coaching Program, I reflected on my teaching practice to identify the points of improvement. During the first meeting, we discussed one challenging student comment that I had difficulties deflecting - denial of their actions - and developed strategies such as a repertoire of questions and a choice statement when the struggle intensifies. Below is the reflection sheet and the note.

After that, I attempted to apply this strategy in action. Whereas I was able to deflect such responses on the spot, I started to have trouble discussing the behaviour afterwards. This can be seen from the log of the second meeting:

During this discussion, I focused on giving the reasons. Instead of relying on the authority, e.g. "you are not allowed to do that to me", I designed a few sentences that focus on the behaviour and its impact, such as, "your behaviour is making me difficult to teach" or "I would like to listen to other students as well, but I cannot when you call out like that". I also wanted to try asking them to decide, for example, "what do you think we need to do from now on?"

I put a few "template" sentences of this kind on my desk to keep myself reminded. I was able to use a few of them; some were useful, such as stating the impact of the behaviour, but others were not. Asking students what they should have done instead would often result in a more agitated "Nothing!". Over time, I developed the list from which I can quickly pick a sentence to address challenging behaviour. My responses were still not perfect by the end of my service at the School, but I could improve my practice a lot, especially in terms of promptness and effectiveness.

Later, I started to wonder the fundamental reasons why students misbehave in my class, and concluded it was because they are disengaged. It was when we moved on to advanced algebra techniques, and many students found it quite difficult. Where some students still persevered through, others would give up and not even try. This became the main topic of the meeting with my mentor:

We focused on making the content approachable to the students. The gradual release of responsibility model ([Pearson and Gallapher, 1983](https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/17939/ctrstreadtechrepv01983i00297_opt.pdf)) and differentiated worksheets were suggested (*Descriptor 1.2*). I was also encouraged to break down the class into smaller pieces.

I planned a lesson on expanding binomials using the strategies we developed:

At first, the PPT slides below are designed for the "I do" part. The students first learns what the FOIL method is and how it is applied to a problem. A wide range of colours are used to help the process. Then I prepared three different questions for guided practising. They were asked to try the questions on their own first, and we checked the answers together. I asked mostly the confident students in the beginning, but also made sure to check other students as well (*Descriptor 4.1*).

Finally, the students are asked to practise individually using the worksheet. It is divided into two parts with different level and scaffolding. The students can choose which part to work on, and the answer sheets are given to the students when they finish them so they can check their work on their own (*Descriptors 1.5 and 5.2*).

The Head of Learning Area was happy to observe the lesson to assist me on the reflection process. Below is his note:

Overall, his feedback aligned with my reflection: the instructions, set up with the gradual release model, and the differentiated worksheet, helped students keep engaged and learn the topic. He also pointed out a few classroom management skills I implemented well, as well as those I needed to improve on, such as minimising the disturbance.

The most obvious one is that there is not enough  motivation for the students to try the difficult questions, and they will just aim to complete the easier side. I complemented this with a  "merit point" system: students could earn points when they complete a  side, and more points are allocated to the more difficult set of  questions. The points can then be exchanged with a prize later on. With this external motivation, many students challenged themselves in class  and improved their algebra skills impressively.
