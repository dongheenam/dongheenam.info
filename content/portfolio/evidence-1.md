The teaching program, activities, and assessments developed for the [Digital Technologies subject](https://k10outline.scsa.wa.edu.au/home/teaching/curriculum-browser/technologies/digital-technologies2) of the WA curriculum.

## Background

To meet the requirements from the WA School Curriculum and Standards Authority, I was nominated to develop a teaching program for the Years 7 and 8 Digital Technologies subject for the School and deliver the content to the students.

Since the School only had 25 teaching hours a week and there were already a handful of electives offered to the students, I was given 30 hours to teach the subject to a group of students over one Term (three hours per week), which is shorter than the recommended length (~40 hours/year).

The School offered a "streamed" learning environment (classes divided based on the students' abilities). However, this does not apply to the options classes. This course was therefore expected to be delivered to a group of students with various capabilities - from above average to with significant learning disabilities.

## Action

Even if I had a good content knowledge, I had no previous  teaching experience in the subject and hence lacked the pedagogical  knowledge. I thus contacted another school that had already been teaching Digital Technologies. I and the Technologies teacher exchanged several verbal and written communications so that I could design a learning program suitable for my School (*Descriptors 2.1*).

I also attended the 2017 Secondary Convention from the Mathematical Association of Western Australia (MAWA) to gather curriculum knowledge and teaching strategies. I chose the MAWA Convention because they align with my primary teaching fields and they also included many Digital Technologies presentations as well (*Descriptors 2.1, 6.1, 6.2*).

The School provided a separated Engagement Program to students who have significant difficulties in working towards the standards of the Australian Curriculum. Because the students in the Program also had to join the class, along with other students, I worked closely with the teacher-in-charge for the Program to identify their individual learning needs, emotional triggers as well as personal interests (*Descriptors 1.6*).

Finally, I exchanged opinions with the Aboriginal and Islander Education Officer (AIEO) and another colleague who worked closely with the Indigenous students. I learned about how some Aboriginal students find difficult to perform a public speech and developed ideas on how to incorporate this into designing the program (*Descriptors 1.4*).

## Outcome

### The Teaching Program

The teaching program, embedded below, was first written in Term One. I then applied and revised the program repeatedly throughout the rest of the Year.

A handful of different activities and assessments are also created throughout the Year to enhance student learning and the measurement thereof. Below are detailed explanations of some of my teaching materials for the Digital Technologies course.

### Activity 1: School network discovery

This is an outdoor activity I planned for students to help relate their knowledge on the computer network to the real life. Below is the lesson plan with my annotations.

### Activity 2: Typing practice

2018 was the first year NAPLAN Online was introduced to the School. Both I and other teachers noticed lots of students struggled during the Writing section because they rarely had any typing experience with a computer keyboard. Almost no one could type without looking at the keyboard, and many used only two fingers.

Because it was a significant concern to the school, I decided to include a 10-minute-long typing practice session as a daily routine for the students. I instructed the students to log in to their computers as soon as they arrive, launch the app and begin typing. This helped the students transition from the previous class and settle down because they knew what to do when they come inside the classroom (*Descriptors 2.5, 2.6, 4.2*).

I chose an online typing solution, [typing.com](typing.com), based on the following advantages it had. First of all, both visual and written instructions are given to the students during the sessions so that students with low literacy skills could also proceed with minimal help. The website provides a lot of different activities, including typing games, to students to increase their engagement. Finally, it allowed the teacher to create, manage, and supervise the student accounts. This was particularly convenient since many students would frequently forget their login details. The entire solution was free and the students could gain access to every learning material they provide (*Descriptors 3.3, 3.4*).

As an assessment tool, I managed an Excel Spreadsheet for students to track their improvements:

{{% figure src="portfolio/img/y7dt_typingrecord.png" caption="Excel spreadsheet for tracking students' typing skills" %}}

In Week 1, students took a three-minute typing test as a diagnosis of their typing abilities. Then, every three weeks, they were repeatedly tested under the same condition. Three students who improved the most (marked green under the Change column) were presented a small prize as well as three students who practised the most (marked green under the Progress column). I could identify a few students who were really motivated every time we do the test, and by the end of the Term, almost everyone agreed that they could type better than before. The progress of the Year group average of the scores from the four typing tests clearly indicate their improvement (see the figure below). This assessment of the student typing skills demonstrates my achievement of *Descriptors 4.1, 5.1, 5.4, and 5.5*.

### Activity 3: Routing roleplay

This activity was designed to provide students with a visual representation of packets and network routing so that they can understand the concepts better. They were first introduced in Term Two, based on the experience in the previous Term that they were particularly different to teach and learn. There was also a strong recommendation from the teaching assistant for the student on the autism spectrum, who loved plays and hands-on activities (*Descriptors 1.6 and 3.6*).

The lesson required a lesson plan, the presentation for the instructions and the cards for the play. Below is the annotated lesson plan.

### Assessment: Presentation project

This is the final assessment I designed for the Digital Technologies teaching program. Since the School had a low attendance rate, especially during the last couple of weeks of a Term, I found an individual project would be ideal, so that students can still join mid-way and leave without stressing others. I finally decided to make it into a presentation project to help students improve on their presentation skills. This also aligned well with the digital literacy and ICT capabilities of the Syllabus, as well as the Process and Production Skills sub-strand. I allowed the students to choose their own topic so that they can concentrate on delivering the presentation. It created another chance for me to get to know the students so I strongly encouraged them to find a theme that is related to their own culture (*Descriptors 1.3, 2.3, 2.6, 3.4*).

This project was first introduced in Term One. Many students would pick a topic and start copying information from the internet, which was not ideal since they did not elaborate their thinking well enough. Therefore, I decided to divide the task into three parts. Students were asked to finish every part before moving on to the next (*Descriptors 1.1 and 3.6*). Firstly, they choose a topic, and list what they already know about it, as well as what they need to search for. This step is particularly important because the students were not allowed to use the internet.

The students were then asked to search on the internet, fill in any missing information, and start creating the presentation. I provided a clear guideline in the following ways.

I stated the aim of the projects first and foremost, which clearly states my expectations. I gave a wide range of choice for the mode of delivery, such as presenting in private or submitting an alternative work. My intention here was for students to feel safer and more comfortable, while being encouraged to 'give it a go'. I knew some Indigenous students, as well as very introverted ones, will find public speech very terrifying and "shame". Students approached me to arrange their private sessions, and later confessed to me that they would not have done it if they were asked to stand in public (*Descriptors 1.4, 3.1, 4.1*).

I also presented a topic myself, as an example work for the students to refer to. I also included counterexamples to teach students what not to do when delivering a speech.

Lastly, all students were given the assessment criteria so that they were fully aware of the requirements. This sheet was also useful for providing detailed, rich feedback to students since we could pin down the areas of improvement (*Descriptor 5.2*). I aimed to create a positive environment during the presentation by explicitly stating that any rude behaviour will be penalised (*Descriptor 4.1*).
