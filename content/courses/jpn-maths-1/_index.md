One of the educational projects I have always dreamed about is providing a way for teachers and students to have a peek at how mathematics is learnt in another country. I regularly tell students how people from a different culture do mathematics differently (well, that includes, how I do maths too!) and this page is an extension to my effort of spreading rich maths culture in a classroom.

I am working on translating the Japanese Secondary Mathematics Curriculum into English. This work is based on a few different study guidebooks (called _Sankousho_) but most of the descriptions are my original. I am also using the online textbook library, [FTEXT](http://www.ftext.org) (absolutely wonderful, and free!). I hope to also include authentic Japanese textbooks in the future but access to textbooks are quite limited outside schools to my knowledge.
