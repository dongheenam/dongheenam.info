## Introduction

What is a number? It is difficult to tell what a number exactly is. What we can do at least is to think of *examples* of numbers. For example, I spent *one and a half* hours to solve *4* maths questions today, and ate *0.2* litres of ice cream, kept frozen at *-18* degrees. All of these numbers sound so natural to us and it is difficult to imagine a world without numbers. However, we now know that all numbers have been invented from time to time, and some numbers became available a lot earlier than the others!

We will learn:

- the different types of numbers commonly used in everyday life: natural numbers, integers, rational and irrational numbers, and real numbers.
- the different representations of rational numbers: decimals and fractions.
- how to convert between decimals and fractions.


## Natural Numbers

The earliest forms of numbers were only used for counting: one, two, three, four, and so on. We call this type of numbers *natural numbers*.

{{% note definition %}}
Numbers such as $1, 2, 3, \dots$ are called *natural numbers* ($\mathbb{N}$).

{{% details title="Fancy symbols!" %}}
Since mathematicians are lazy people, and a lot of them do not understand English, they developed an easier way to communicate: symbols! So instead of saying 'natural number' every time you want to mention it, you can simply write $\mathbb{N}$.

### Arithmetic with natural numbers

{{% mn 61 %}}This section is beyond what is usually taught here, but I find it quite interesting and relevant. Feel free to skip.{{% /mn %}}
I know this is not a Year 1 class, but let's talk about adding and multiplying natural numbers, such as $2+4$ and $2\times 4$. Here is a question: can you add two natural numbers to get anything else than a natural number? Likewise, is multiplying two natural numbers always equal to another natural number? You can have a deep thought about it, try a few different combinations, but you will find that you will *always* get another natural number!

{{% note definition %}}
The *addition* or *multiplication* of any two natural numbers is another natural number. In other words, natural numbers are *closed* under addition and multiplication.

Now, let's think about subtraction. If you take a natural number from another, will the answer be always a natural number? While this is sometimes true, like $7 - 4 = 3$, you may find some of the subtractions cannot be done only using natural numbers, such as this one: $4 - 6 = \phantom{0}?$

{{% note theorem %}}
If you *subtract* a natural number from another, the result is not always a natural number. In other words, natural numbers are *not closed* under subtraction.

How do we fix this problem? One way is to ban everyone from doing such calculation (I still remember my primary school teacher saying I cannot take a number from a smaller number). A better way is to come up with a different set of numbers so that we can subtract freely. As you have guessed, we will be talking about *negative* numbers next!


## Integers

You may be familiar that the answer to $4-6$ is $-2$. If this does not make a lot of sense, imagine you having four dollars in your wallet. You want to buy a six-dollar lunch but you don't have enough case, so you borrow some money from your close friend. Now you are in two dollars in debt. Likewise, $$4-6=-2.$$

In order to make sure we can subtract anything from anything, we need negative counting numbers, such as $-1,-2,-3,\dots$, as well as zero because $2-2=0$ and so on. These numbers are part of the *integers*.

{{% note definition %}}
Numbers such as $0,+1,-1,+2,-2,\dots$ are called *integers* ($\mathbb{Z}$).

{{% note theorem %}}
Integers are closed under addition, multiplication, and *subtraction*.

{{% details title="Why Z?" %}}
While the symbol for natural numbers, $\mathbb{N}$, is pretty straightforward, $\mathbb{Z}$ for integers is not as obvious. This symbol comes from the German word *Zahlen*, which means *numbers*. In fact, the popular language for mathematics and physics was Latin originally (*vinculum*, for example) as well as Arabic (*algebra*, *algorithm*, ...), then moved to German. That's why we still see a lot of German influence in science and mathematics!

<p></p>

### Dividing integers

We have not finished yet -- we need to talk about dividing! And that is right, even if we now have negative numbers, we cannot divide every integer by another to get an integer. For example, $5\div 2$ has a remainder $1$. So what do we need to make sure we can divide every number by another? The answer is, we need *fractions*!

## Rational Numbers

You may remember practices like $$ 5\div 2 = \dfrac{5}{2} = 2\dfrac{1}{2} . $$ It may be easy to actually *do* these tricks, but it is a little more to explain what these symbols really *means*. What we are actually calculating here is the *ratio*. For example, $5$ is two and a half $(=2\frac{1}{2})$ times bigger than $2$, or the *ratio* of $5$ to $2$ is two and a half. If we collect all the possible ratios between integers, or in other words, divide every possible combinations of two integers, we get *rational* numbers.

{{% note definition %}}
Any number in a form $\dfrac{a}{b}$, where $a$, $b$ are integers and $b$ is not zero, is a *rational number* $(\mathbb{Q})$.

{{% details title="Q for ..." %}}
Now you must be looking for a word that start with *Q* and has the meaning of ratio. While the symbol $\mathbb{Q}$ did come from a German word, the matching English word also starts with Q: *quotients*.

<p></p>

{{% /details %}}

Note that all integers are also rational numbers, because the ratio of any number to one is the number itself (for example, $-3=\frac{-3}{1}$). Now, if you divide an integer by another, you are sure to end up with a rational number. If you divide a fraction by another, you will also get a fraction: for example, $$ -\dfrac{2}{3} \div \dfrac{7}{3} = -\dfrac{2}{\bcancel{3}} \times \dfrac{\bcancel{3}}{7} = -\dfrac{2}{7}. $$

So our journey has completed! We have finally found a set of numbers we can freely divide. Here is a list of different types of numbers we discussed so far:

{{% box %}}
$$
\text{Rationals} 
\begin{cases}
    \text{Integers} 
    \begin{cases}
      \text{Positive integers} = \text{Naturals } (2, 7, 42, \dots) \\\\
      0 \\\\
      \text{Negative integers } (-3, -5, -119, \dots)
    \end{cases} \\\\ \\\\
    \text{Fractions } (\dfrac{2}{3}, -\dfrac{1}{2}, \dots) 
\end{cases}
$$
{{% /box %}}

There is one problem though -- it is the troublesome $0$. Because we cannot divide a number by zero, we usually do not include it when we talk about division, like this:

{{% note theorem %}}
Rational numbers are closed under addition, subtraction, and multiplication. Rational numbers *without zero* are closed under *division*.


## Decimal Representation of Numbers

{{% mn olympics %}}
{{% img src="courses/jpn-maths-1/numbers-and-expressions/num-olympics.jpg" alt="Result from a swimming world championship." %}}

{{% /mn %}}

So far we focused on numbers for counting. Numbers also appear in *measurements*, such as length, weight, temperature, time, and so on. While we often just use whole numbers (integers) for measuring, like *180 cm* or *73 kg*, sometimes we need to be more accurate. Athletic competition is a good example -- the winner of a swimming championship can change by much less than a second. We use *decimals* to make sure we can tell who is faster than the others.

The 'usual' type of decimals have only a certain number of digits after the decimal point. For example, The swimming competition results from the picture have two digits. That is up to one hundredth of a second. The more accurate you measure, the more digits you need. For example, the mass of a Hydrogen atom is about: 

\begin{align}
  & 1.6735576929 \times 10^{-27} ~\text{kg} \\\\
  &= 0.0000000000000000000000000016735576929 ~\text{kg}!
\end{align}

Now, that is a lot of digits, but it certainly ends at some point. On the other hand, you may have heard of a decimal that never ends. For example, if you divide $10$ by $3$, you will get an endless bunch of repeating $3$s: $$ 10\div3 = 3.3333333333\cdots, $$

or you are familiar with the mysterious number $\pi$: $$ \pi = 3.14159265353 \cdots . $$

{{% note definition %}}
*Finite* decimals have a certain number of decimal places. *Infinite* decimals have never-ending decimal places.

Some infinite decimals have repeating blocks, for example, you can see the sequence $123$ repeats forever in the decimal $0.123123123\cdots$. These types of decimals are called *repeating*.

{{% box %}}
{{% note definition %}}
*Repeating decimals* are decimals with a sequence of numbers repeating infinitely. 

{{% note example %}}
Below are repeating decimals:
  - $0.1666666 \cdots$
  - $0.17\\,17\\,17\\,17\\,17 \cdots$
  - $5.835\\,835\\,835\\,835 \cdots$

Below are NOT repeating decimals:
  - $0.5772156649015\cdots$
  - $0.12345678910111213\cdots$

{{% /box %}}

You can clearly see that $3.3333\cdots$ is a repeating decimal, while $\pi$ is not. Another good example for a non-repeating, infinite decimal is a surd: $$ \sqrt{2} = 1.414213562\cdots. $$ We write dots ($\cdot$) on top of numbers to tell the repeating part. For example,

\begin{alignat}{2}
  & 0.1666666\cdots &&= 0.1\dot{6}, \\\\
  & 0.17171717\cdots &&= 0.\dot{1}\dot{7}, \\\\
  & 5.835835835\cdots &&= 5.\dot{8}3\dot{5}.
\end{alignat}

Let's summarise the three different terms for decimals before moving on!

{{% box %}}
$$
\text{Decimals} 
\begin{cases}
    \text{Finite } (0.175, -3.8, 16) \\\\ \\\\
    \text{Infinite }
    \begin{cases}
      \text{Repeating } (0.\dot{3}, 7.\dot{31}) \\\\
      \text{Non-repeating } (\pi, 0.5772156\cdots)
    \end{cases}
\end{cases}
$$
{{% /box %}}


## Real Numbers

We talked about numbers as a counter, and numbers as a measurement. We now know that we often use rational numbers when we count, and we use decimals for measuring. Together we have every number we use in real life -- so we call them, *real numbers*!

{{% note definition %}}
The collection of rational numbers and finite and infinite decimals is called *real numbers*. ($\mathbb{R}$)

### Converting fractions to decimals

We could close up this lesson here, but there are a lot of overlapping part between rationals and decimals. For example, $1.0$ (decimal) is obviously the same as $1$ (natural), and $\frac{1}{2}$ (rational) is $0.5$ (decimal). In order to better classify the real numbers, we need to try converting decimals and rationals and finding some patterns. Here we are not going to spend too much time practising the conversion because you should have had a few exercises throughout high school. For example, {{% mn logdiv1 %}}{{% img src="courses/jpn-maths-1/numbers-and-expressions/num-longdiv_1.svg" alt="Long division workout for 1 divide 8." style="max-width: 50%" %}}{{% /mn %}}

$$\dfrac{5}{8} = 5\div 8 = 0.625$$ and $$0.85 = \dfrac{\bcancel{85}^{13}}{\bcancel{100}^{20}} = \dfrac{13}{20}.$$

For the example above, the division ends and you can express the fraction as a finite decimal. However, not all fractions behave this way -- the division never ends for some fractions! Have a look at the long division for $\dfrac{1}{6}$, for example. {{% mn logdiv2 %}}{{% img src="courses/jpn-maths-1/numbers-and-expressions/num-longdiv_2.svg" alt="Long division workout for 1 divide 6." style="max-width: 50%" %}}{{% /mn %}}

We get $$\dfrac{1}{6} = 0.1\dot{6}. $$ 

So far we have found a fraction that equals a finite decimal, and another fraction that equals a repeating decimal. That leaves us one question: can we find a fraction that is equivalent to a non-repeating, infinite decimal? Certainly you can give it a try, and you might find some fractions have a long repeating part, like

$$ \dfrac{1}{17} = 0.\dot{0}58823529411764\dot{7}, $$

but you will find that every fraction has a repeating sequence in their decimal representation.

{{% note theorem %}}
*Every fraction* can be expressed as either a finite decimal or a repeating decimal.

This means that non-repeating infinite numbers are NOT rational numbers! That is why we call them *irrational*, which means, literally, not rational.

{{% note definition %}}
*Irrational numbers* are real numbers that cannot be expressed as a ratio (fraction). Their decimal representation is always an infinite decimal with no repeating sequence.

{{% details title="Irrational, rational, and ratio" %}}
You may think, the words *ratio*nal and *irratio*nal came from *ratio*. However, it is completely the opposite! When the ancient Greeks found the number $\sqrt{2}$, it made no sense to them because they could not find any ratios that equals $\sqrt{2}$. So they named it irrational, as in *non-reasonable*. The terms rational and ratio are later derived from the word irrational. It is weird, isn't it?

### Converting decimals to fractions

You may be familiar with converting finite decimals to fractions, such as

\begin{alignat}{2}
  &0.7 &&= \dfrac{7}{10}, \\\\
  &0.375 &&= \dfrac{\bcancel{375}^3}{\bcancel{1000}^8} = \dfrac{3}{8}.
\end{alignat}

What about repeating decimals like $0.\dot{5}=0.555\cdots$? Well, we can think this way. We first say the value of this decimal is $x$, or in other words, $$x=0.555\cdots. \tag{1} $$ Can you think what $10x$ would equal to? It should be $$10x=5.555\cdots. \tag{2} $$ Note both $x$ and $10x$ have the same decimal part $555\cdots$. This means, if you take $(1)$ from $(2)$, they will be gone! So:

\begin{array}{rrlll}
  & 10x & = 5\hl{.555\cdots} && \cdots (2) \\\\
 -(& x & =0.\hl{555\cdots} & ) & \cdots (1) \\\\[0.5em]
  \hline 
  & 9x & = 5 &&
\end{array}

This means, of course, $$ x = \dfrac{5}{9}. $$

You can use similar trick to convert more complex decimals to fractions. See the examples below.

{{% box %}}
{{% note example %}}
Convert the following decimals to fractions.
  1. $0.44$
  2. $0.\dot{8}$
  3. $0.\dot{2}7\dot{5}$
  4. $0.1\dot{3}\dot{6}$

{{% note solution %}}

$\text{a.} \quad 0.44 = \dfrac{\bcancel{44}^{11}}{\bcancel{100}^{25}} = \boldsymbol{\dfrac{11}{25}}.$

$\text{b.} \quad$ We set $x=0.888\cdots$. Then

\begin{array}{rrll}
  & 10x & = 8.888\cdots & \\\\
 -(& x & =0.888\cdots & ) \\\\[0.5em]
  \hline 
  & 9x & = 8 &&
\end{array}

and therefore $ x = \boldsymbol{\dfrac{8}{9} }$.

$\text{c.} \quad$ We set $x=0.275275\cdots$. We need to find a multiple of $x$ that has the same decimal part (note $10x=2.752752\cdots$ has a *different* decimal part to $x$!). To do so, we need $1000x$ instead:

\begin{array}{rrll}
  & 1000x & = 275.275275\cdots & \\\\
 -(& x & =\phantom{00}0.275275\cdots & ) \\\\[0.5em]
  \hline 
  & 999x & = 275 &&
\end{array}

Therefore $x = \boldsymbol{\dfrac{275}{999}}$.

$\text{d.} \quad$ We set $x=0.13636\cdots$. Ideally, we want to keep the decimal part $3636\cdots$, so the first equation would be on $10x$ and the other on $1000x$: 

\begin{array}{rrll}
  & 1000x & = 136.3636\cdots & \\\\
 -(& 10x & =\phantom{00}1.3636\cdots & ) \\\\[0.5em]
  \hline 
  & 990x & = 135 &&
\end{array}

Thus $x=\dfrac{\bcancel{135}^{15}}{\bcancel{990}\_{110}}=\dfrac{\bcancel{15}^3}{\bcancel{110}\_{22}}=\boldsymbol{ \dfrac{3}{22} }$.

{{% /box %}}

{{% details title="0.999...=?" %}}
Whether $0.999$ equals $1$ or not is a little old topic, but here is a proof using what we have learnt so far. Let $x=0.999\cdots$. Then

\begin{array}{rrll}
  & 10x & = 9.999\cdots & \\\\
 -(& x & =0.999\cdots & ) \\\\[0.5em]
  \hline 
  & 9x & = 9 &&
\end{array}

and obviously, the answer to the equation is $x=1$! $\square$

$\text{b.} \quad$ Set $x=0.\dot{4}$. Then
