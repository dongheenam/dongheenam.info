In elementary school, students learn the meaning and rules of four fundamental operations with non-negative integers, as well as their applications in Grade 4. In Grades 5 and 6, students broaden their perspective of numbers and extend their knowledge on arithmetic through the three laws of arithmetic and applying the four operations to decimals and fractions. In particular, students learn different representations and calculation techniques of decimals until Grade 5, and those of fractions until Grade 6.

In Grade 1 of lower secondary school, students expand the range of numbers to negative numbers. Students are to understand the meaning of positive and negative numbers, the meaning of adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing with positive and negative numbers, practise their techniques, and apply them to the real world.

*The necessity and meaning of positive and negative numbers*

Help students understand the necessity of positive and negative numbers by relating them to previous knowledge or everyday situations, such as temperature difference between days. You may show students, by using positive and negative numbers, it is possible to:
- express opposite directions or properties as numbers,
- compare the size of any two numbers,
- place a number on the number line,
- subtract any number from another, and
- interchange addition and subtraction.

The concept of expanding the range of numbers is gradually introduced to students since the first grade of elementary school. In lower secondary curriculum, students need to define integers to include negative numbers. By inquiring into the concept of the set of integers, and its closure under the four fundamental operations, students are to consolidate their understanding of numbers.

*Four fundamental operations with positive and negative numbers*

Students expand the knowledge of arithmetic from elementary school, to positive and negative numbers. Students should also understand the meaning of each operation. For example, one may start from adding two numbers of same sign and use the concept of absolute values to add two numbers of different signs. In this way, students can establish subtraction, multiplication and division of two integers. This practise becomes important when square roots are introduced in Grade 3.

It is also possible to use the concept of additive inverse to define subtraction, analogous to defining dividing by a fraction as multiplying its multiplicative inverse in elementary school. For example, calculating $3-2$ is seen as subtracting $2$ from $3$, but is also equivalent to $(+3)+(-2)$, i.e., as addition of $+3$ and $-2$.

*Applying positive and negative numbers*

Help students use positive and negative numbers to express and simplify real-life problems, and understand their meanings. For example, one can use an integer to represent the difference between the target and daily values and visualise whether or not the target is met each day.

*Prime factorisation of natural numbers*

In elementary school, students learn basic properties of non-negative integers, and the definition of odd and even numbers, divisors and multiples, greatest common divisors and least common multiples. Here, students learn that natural numbers are divided into different categories based on their number of factors, and numbers with exactly two distinct factors are called prime numbers. Students find that any non-prime natural numbers greater than one can be broken into a product of smaller numbers, and if any of those numbers are not prime, they can be further broken into even smaller ones. This procedure can be repeated until all the numbers in the product are prime. This exercise is called the prime factorisation, whose result is unique for each natural number. Students can use prime factorisation to rediscover properties of other concepts, such as divisors and multiples.

{{% details title="Previous knowledge" %}}

In elementary school, students learn how expressions with numbers, words, and symbols such as $\square$ and $\triangle$ can be used to write quantitative relationships and theorems until the end of Grade 4. In Grade 5, students further investigate quantitative relationships represented by simple expressions with symbols. In Grade 6, students start to use letters such as $a$ or $x$, instead of symbols, to write an algebraic expression, and solve simple equations by trial-and-error.

In Grade 1 of lower secondary school, students understand that pronumerals are powerful ways to deal with relationships and mathematical laws. When teaching, it is often useful to re-introduce the topics from primary school, such as word and symbol expressions, so that students have a gradual introduction to using letters in an expression.

{{% details title="Previous knowledge" %}}

In primary school mathematics, students broaden their perspectives on shapes and their components through observations and physical representations. Students investigate on various plane shapes, such as triangles (including isosceles and equilateral triangles) and quadrilaterals (including parallelograms, trapeziums, rhombuses, and squares) by the end of Grade 4. Students learn about equivalent shapes in Grade 5, and scaling (enlarging or shrinking) and symmetry in Grade 6.

In Grade 1 of the lower secondary school, students construct plane shapes (with a ruler and a compass only) with their symmetry in mind, and study the relationship between two plane shapes. Through this practice, students develop their understanding of geometric shapes and their logical thinking skills in geometry.

3. *Key words and symbols:* solid of revolution, skew lines, $\pi$.

{{% details title="Previous knowledge" %}}

In primary school mathematics, students observe and classify various types of solids from Grade 1, so that they can gradually treat them as abstract shapes.
In Grade 2, students start to focus on the components of solids. Students study spheres in Grade 3, and by the end of Grade 5, students investigate on cubes, prisms and cylinders through their sketches and nets.

In Grade 1 of lower secondary mathematics, students begin to interpret a solid as a three-dimensional shape, i.e., a combination of parts of lines and planes in the three-dimensional space. Also, students deepen their understanding of three-dimensional shapes from various observations and physical activities, such as designing their nets and sketching. Students should treat measurements of the shapes as fundamental properties of three-dimensional shapes, rather than focusing just on the methods of calculation. Finally, it should be noted that conic solids are first introduced to students in this grade level.

In elementary school, students learn different types of graphs, such as bar, line and pie graphs, represent frequencies in graphs or tables. Also, students identify the (arithmetic) mean of data in Grade 5, and students in Grade 6 calculate the three measures of centre (mean, median, and mode) and utilise dot graphs.

In Grade 1 of lower secondary mathematics, students study the different methods of collecting, analysing, and reducing data. Students also learn to read the trend of data and make critical conclusions on the data using new statistical tools such as histograms and relative frequencies.
