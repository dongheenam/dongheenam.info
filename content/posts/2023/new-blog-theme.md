This blog was my first journey into web development. Fresh from the [FreeCodeCamp tutorials](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), I spent weeks grappling with the official Hugo documentation and naming CSS classes. I eventually managed to craft a website based on [Tufte CSS](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/) and the [Academic](https://academic-demo.netlify.app/) theme.

I have finally settled with [KaTeX](../rendering-maths).

Since then, I've dedicated a good amount of time to crafting cool shortcodes, updating CSS, and deciding which math-rendering libraries I should use. Every time I revamped its structure or worked on other web projects, frustration surged. I questioned my initial project structure and everything seemed like it needed a complete overhaul. It looked ugly and working with the spacing was painful.

Then, I found Butterick's [Practical Typography](https://practicaltypography.com/), and it was a game-changer. The read was delightful and my motivation was here. I had to act!

Roughly 20 hours later, I have a new blog theme in my hands, reminding about this quote from [Flavio](https://flaviocopes.com/boring-stack/) that I need more reflection on:

> Don't work on your blog infrastructure if you want to do any serious blogging. Otherwise you'll spend most of your free time tweaking the blog platform (which - let's be clear - no one except you cares about).

Perhaps I could have resumed my Japanese Maths series, or wrote some notes on science, statistics, or teaching. But here I am, with a sense of joy and accomplishment. With some motivation and time I have left with, here are some tips and codes for future myself. Feel free to have a look.


Perhaps I could have continued my Japanese Maths series, or jotted down some insights on science, statistics, or education. But here I am, full of joy and accomplishment. Unlike Fermat, I do have some time and motivation left, so I've compiled some tips for my future self. Feel free to have a look.
