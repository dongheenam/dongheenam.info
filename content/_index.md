My name is Donghee and I am a mathematics and physics teacher working at a high school in Canberra, Australia.

The main reason I created this website is to share my teaching portfolio and the Japanese mathematics course. You will also find posts on astrophysics, Python and Hugo in the near future.

Until I find a reliable way to share my emails, you can visit my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/dongheenam).
