## E-mail sent to parents on student performance

This is an email sent to the parent whose child failed to submit his assignment on time.

{{% figure noresize="true" src="portfolio/img/comm_let1.png" caption="Letter sent to the parent on urging assignment submission" %}}

It shows how I communicate professionally to the parents about student performance, for the following reasons (*Descriptors 3.7, 5.5, 7.3*):

  * The letter begins with informative introduction, to let them know who I am and why I sent this letter.
  * It describes the background so that they are fully aware of the situation.
  * I clearly explained what was expected from the student, and asked the parents for a cooperation in a respectful manner.
  * The consequence is also explained in detail. I tried to give an impression that I did not personally want this to happen.
  * I ended the email with positive comments on the student to encourage the student and the parents.

## Student assessment reports

Here I show a few student report comments to parents and carers. I adopted the APAL (Achievement -- Progress -- Action -- Language) model to write concise but detailed comments for the students (*Descriptor 5.5*). The APAL model can be described as follows:

  * <span style="color:dodgerblue">**Achievement sentence**</span> outlines the overall outcome of the student.
  * <span style="color:deeppink">**Progress sentence**</span> describes the skills and abilities in detail.
  * <span style="color:springgreen">**Action sentence**</span> suggests areas of improvement for future.
  * *Language* is kept short, clear and familiar (without educational jargon).

Below are the examples. Note each part is colour-coded so that the structure can be clearly seen.

## Information Letters Sent to Parents

Below shows some of the other parent letters I wrote to organise extra-curricular activities. The letters are divided into three parts: brief description of the event and its rationale; when and where the students will be participating in the event, as well as how they will be supervised; and the request for parent permission, if required. I believe that the letters exhibit how I communicate with parents professionally and efficiently (*Descriptors 7.3*).
