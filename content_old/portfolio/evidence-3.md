## Improvements on the Staff and Student Usage of the School Network

During my service at the School, I identified many problems on how ICT was utilised. Many staff and students were frustrated because of the limited bandwidth, as well as shortage of the shared drive space. I therefore decided to help other teachers and administrators tackle this problem more directly and efficiently.

### Action and Outcome

My first goal was to completely redesign the shared resources folders for Mathematics and Science learning areas. I requested for an administrator role of the School's Standard Operating Environment so that I could directly edit the files and folders uploaded by other staff.

This figure_resize was sent to the Science teachers to assist with the transition. The teaching staff found the refined database much easier to use, and pre-service teachers and new teachers had little difficulties finding the appropriate resources.

Next, I delivered a presentation in an all-staff meeting to assist other teachers on the use of ICT at School. My ten-minute speech outlined the school network infrastructure, drew attention to the relevant Department of Education policies, and suggested strategies to use the internet and shared drives more efficiently (*Descriptors 4.5, 6.3, 7.2*). Below are the annotated snapshots of my presentation.

I believed that all staff should know that their login profiles, as well as the students' profiles, are stored in the central server, not in the local system. I referred to the Department documents on the Standard Operating Environment to help the staff understand how the drives are structured, and why. Many staff and students complained on the exceptionally long waiting time for students to log into the school computers. Even some staff had the same problems. I provided some solutions during the presentation so that all teachers can contribute to mitigate the problem. After the presentation, I confirmed that not only staff profiles but also student profiles reduced their sizes in average. There was overall a 30 per cent decrease in the usage of the shared network drive. Furthermore, teachers could implement more ICT into their lessons thanks to the reduced network congestion.

## Supervision of Club Activities

I was nominated to supervise the Board Games club for the lower secondary students. Because the competition for the other clubs was very high, the majority of the students joining my club did not intend to do so. They found board games irrelevant to them and boring. Therefore, I found it necessary to broaden the spectrum of the activities to fulfill their needs better.

### Action and Outcomes

I first asked the students to brainstorm on how to reshape the club. A lot suggested if they could bring their video games and play with their friends. After the coordinator of the club program granted me the permission to do so, I started gathering the relevant Department policies on the use of media in school. I found [the Use of Non-print Texts in Schools policy](http://det.wa.edu.au/policies/detcms/policy-planning-and-accountability/policies-framework/guidelines/use-of-texts-in-educational-settings.en) clearly guidelines how the computer games in each Classification should be introduced in class. Since the parents must be informed when materials of PG rating are used{{% sn "policy" %}}The policy was different in 2017. Under the current policy, teachers must seek parent consent when PG materials are used in classroom for students under 15.{{% /sn %}}, I sent a letter to the parents of the club members, which can be shown below. This overall process demonstrates my achievement of *Descriptors 7.1, 7.2, and 7.3*.

This change was a success, and many students were positive about it. I then pushed this idea even further, to transform it into a Video Games club. It became one of the most famous club activities. Some of the games students brought were educational as well; I could introduce them in class as a literacy and numeracy training tool.
