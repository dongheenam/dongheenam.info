- In Grade 1 of lower secondary mathematics, students extend the range of numbers to include negative numbers, and grow their ability to work with negative numbers and apply them to real-life scenarios. In Grade 3, students are first introduced to irrational numbers with square roots, and learn how to simplify expressions with square roots. In Mathematics I, students learn the union of all numbers discussed in elementary and lower secondary mathematics forms the set of real numbers, and discover their properties, such as its closure under the four fundamental operations, and its one-to-one correspondence with the number line.
- While students do not learn the formal definition of sets in lower secondary school, students experience the basic concepts of sets from the definition of functions and classifications of quadrilaterals. Prior to Mathematics I, students use the idea of hypothesis, converse, and counter-examples when proving properties of numbers and figures.
- In Grade 1 of lower secondary school, students understand that a quantity, relationship or rule can be written with an expression, and add, subtract and simplify linear expressions. In Grade 2, students add and subtract higher-order expressions, and multiply and divide a term by another. Students in Grade 3 practise multiplying an expression with a term, dividing an expression by a term, and expanding simple binomial products.

### B. Shapes and Measurement (Comments p. 37)

1. *Knowledge and skills.* Students will be able to:
    1. Understand the definition of trigonometric ratios of acute angles and the relationship between the ratios.{{% sn trig %}}The Comments specifies the following identities as examples: $\sin A = \cos(90^\circ - A),$ $\cos A = \sin(90^\circ - A),$ $\tan A = \dfrac{\sin A}{\cos A}, $ $\sin^2 A + \cos^2 A = 1,$ $1+\tan^2 A = \dfrac{1}{\cos^2 A}.$ {{% /sn %}}
    2. Extend the definition of trigonometric ratios to include obtuse angles (up to 180 degrees), and find the values of the trigonometric ratios of obtuse angles with the ratios of the corresponding acute angles.{{% sn extra3 %}}Also discuss the trigonometric ratios of 0, 90, and 180 degrees.{{% /sn %}}
    3. Use the sine rule and the cosine rule to find unknown 
    angles or side lengths of a (non-right-angled) triangle.
2. *Ability to think, judge and express.* Students will be able to:
    1. Use trigonometry to express an angle or a side length of a figure as a function of other components, and prove rules or theorems.
    2. Apply the knowledge of geometry to analyse and solve real-life problems.
3. *Key words and symbols:* adjacent (side), opposite (side), hypotenuse, sine, cosine, tangent.

In Grade 3 of lower secondary mathematics, students learn the properties of similar shapes and the Pythagoras' theorem and their applications.

### C. Functions (Comments p. 41)

1. *Knowledge and skills.* Students will be able to:
    1. Understand the characteristics of quadratic functions and their graphs.
    2. Find the minimum or maximum of a quadratic function.
    3. Understand the relationship between the solutions of a quadratic equation and the graph of its corresponding quadratic function, and solve quadratic equations with their graphical representations.
2. *Ability to think, judge and express.* Students will be able to:
    1. Use appropriate methods, including digital technologies, to investigate the connections between algebraic and graphical representations of quadratic functions.
    2. Apply the concepts of quadratic functions to the real life to mathematically analyse an event or find its relationship with another phenomenon.

In lower secondary mathematics, students build their knowledge of directly proportional ($y = ax$), inversely proportional ($y = \frac{a}{x}$), linear ($y = ax + b$), and simple quadratic ($y = ax^2$) relationships. However, the term "quadratic functions" is not introduced to students when learning functions of $y=ax^2$ form.

### D. Analysis of Data (Comments p. 43)

1. *Knowledge and skills.* Students will be able to:
    1. Understand the definition and use of variance, standard deviation, scatter plot, and correlation coefficient.
    2. Use digital technologies to summarise data in appropriate tables or graphs, and calculate basic statistical measures such as variance and standard deviation.
2. *Ability to think, judge and express.* Students will be able to:
    1. Discover different methods of quantifying the scatter and trend of data.
    2. Investigate a phenomenon by collecting the data that suits the purpose of investigation, analysing the data with statistical measures and graphs, finding the trend of the data, and drawing conclusions about the phenomenon.
    3. Discuss the validity of a claim on the likelihood of an event through experiments and critical thinking.
3. *Key words and symbols:* outliers.

In elementary school mathematics, students learn how to arrange and sort data, represent data as a graph or a table, and their applications. Students also practise the use of ratios and rates, which are linked with the concepts of probability.

In lower secondary school mathematics,
- students in Grade 1 learn how to collect data, draw graphs or tables with digital technologies to find any trends and make conclusions;
- students in Grade 2 compare two sets of data by calculating interquartile ranges and drawing box plots;
- students in Grade 3 sample a subset of a population to estimate the statistics of the population, and critically analyse claims based on a sampling method.
